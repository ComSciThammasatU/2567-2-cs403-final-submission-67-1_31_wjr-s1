This research presents a sentiment analysis system for movie reviews collected from online platforms. The system is designed to facilitate the interpretation of public opinion regarding films by providing an overview of audience sentiment. The study focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model using user comments from YouTube and X (formerly Twitter) as primary data sources. The comments are categorized into positive and negative sentiments through the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.
The sentiment classification model was trained and evaluated using two machine learning methods: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The analysis results demonstrate that the Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy, with a classification accuracy of 89.63%, thereby outperforming the SVM model.
